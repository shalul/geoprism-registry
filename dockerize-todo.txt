-- Notes --
Best way to test right now is to add
POSTGRES_ROOT_PASSWORD and POSTGRES_ROOT_USERNAME params to cargo run launch, delete your database, and boot.


-- TODO --
- Hopefully there is no ramifications from making the DatabaseBuilder do install or patch (but not install and then patch).
- Rewrite ansible scripts
- Do we want to embed SSL into this?
- Documentation


-- DONE --
- Write a Dockerfile and docker-compose file and get it to boot from fresh install
- Make sure we can boot when the database doesn't yet exist and our db builder will create it
- Make sure that we can boot whether or not a database exists, i.e. clean install or patch




==== Idiot-proof Environment Setup ====
- Switch projects to docker branches
-- georegistry to 'dockerize'
-- geoprism to 'dockerize'
-- runway to 'docker'
- Pull and merge latest code into branches
- Switch poms to correct versions
- maven clean install on projects
- Make sure cargo run has envs
