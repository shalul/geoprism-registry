-- Notes --
Best way to test right now is to add
POSTGRES_ROOT_PASSWORD and POSTGRES_ROOT_USERNAME params to cargo run launch, delete your database, and boot.


-- TODO --
- Make sure that we can boot whether or not a database exists, i.e. clean install or patch
- Hopefully there is no ramifications from making the DatabaseBuilder do install or patch (but not install and then patch).


-- DONE --
- Make sure we can boot when the database doesn't yet exist and our db builder will create it
